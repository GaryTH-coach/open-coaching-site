  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m Gary Handforth — a leadership coach, strategist, and educational consultant with over two decades of experience shaping schools and systems to better serve learners and communities.</p>
<p>My approach is rooted in openness, reflection, and connection. I don’t bring off-the-shelf answers. Instead, I work with you to uncover new perspectives, challenge assumptions, and build clarity in complexity. Whether supporting a school leadership team, designing a coaching culture, or exploring AI’s role in decision-making, I aim to provoke meaningful, grounded change.</p>

<h2 id="as-a-speaker-and-facilitator">As a Speaker and Facilitator</h2>
<p>I speak at national conferences and roundtables on AI in education, leadership, and ethical innovation. My sessions invite critical thinking and constructive discomfort — always with a view to impact and inclusion.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
<p>I believe leadership is relational, not hierarchical; adaptive, not rigid. I draw from process consultancy, systems thinking, and posthumanist philosophy to create learning environments where people flourish and systems evolve.</p>
