## AI in Education: The Promise and the Peril

Explore the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in education and the critical need for systemic reform. From adaptive learning to reducing inequalities, this thought-provoking piece examines how AI can enrich creativity, curiosity, and connection while cautioning against the risks of over-optimisation and shallow metrics. Will AI reshape education for human flourishing, or will it amplify existing inequities?

### The Paperclip Maximiser
AI in Education: Transformation or More of the Same?
The Paperclip Maximiser
Imagine an artificial intelligence tasked with a simple goal: to produce as many paperclips as possible. In the beginning, it optimises production efficiently. However, without ethical constraints, the AI soon begins to consume all available resources—mountains, forests, oceans, even human lives—to achieve its prime objective. Once Earth's resources are depleted, it moves on into space with giant paperclip rockets, consuming entire planets, never stopping. This thought experiment, introduced by Nick Bostrom (2014), illustrates the dangers of a relentless focus on optimisation without considering broader consequences.
Now, imagine an education system with an unrelenting emphasis on conformity, standardisation, metrics, and performativity. Sounds familiar? Such a system risks eroding its true purpose: fostering curiosity, creativity, and human connection. What happens when we integrate AI into an education system like this?
Without systemic reform and ethical guardrails, integrating AI into an already flawed education system risks creating a "paperclip factory" of its own—optimising metrics at the expense of creativity, curiosity, and connection.
A System in Crisis
Our education system is at a breaking point. Standardised testing, rigid metrics, and an obsession with performativity have created a culture that prioritises efficiency over meaningful learning. Teaching is reduced to inputs, and students to outputs—grades, rankings, and league tables—while teachers face burnout from relentless bureaucratic demands.
The consequences are stark. Between 2017 and 2023, the prevalence of probable mental disorders in children aged 8–16 rose from 12.5% to 20.3%, with similar trends for older adolescents (NHS Digital, 2023). Meanwhile, disadvantaged pupils now lag 19.2 months behind their peers by the end of secondary school—the largest gap since 2012 (Education Policy Institute, 2024). Teacher retention rates are also alarming; in England, approximately 33% of new teachers leave the profession within five years and a recent survey by the Department for Education revealed that 34% of school leaders are considering leaving the profession within the next year (DfE, 2023).
These figures underscore a system in crisis—one that prioritises efficiency and outcomes over well-being, widening inequities and manifesting what Han (2015) described as a "burnout society."
Performativity and Shallow Metrics
Our education system mirrors the shallow validation-seeking culture prevalent in social media. Just as individuals pursue likes and shares, schools chase end of key stage grades and performance table positions. This relentless focus on measurable outputs creates systemic anxiety and undermines deeper, intrinsic growth.
As Einstein famously observed, ‘Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.’ Yet the education system remains trapped in the logic of computational thinking—a framework that only values what can be quantified, one that reduces complex human experiences to binary, measurable outcomes (Bridle, 2018). Creativity, curiosity, and human connection are sidelined in favour of conformity and comparison.
The roots of this reductive approach run deep. Ludwik Fleck (1935) described ‘thought styles’ and ‘thought collectives’ that shape how knowledge is understood and valued. Education's prevailing thought collective is the ‘mind-as-computer’ metaphor, treats the brain as a processor of packets of facts, severely limiting our understanding of learning and memory. This mechanistic view dismisses forms of knowledge that resist standardisation and measurement, reinforcing a school system ill-equipped to prepare children for their futures and stripping them of their potential.
The Age of Attention and Cognitive Overload
We are living in the Age of Attention, where technology and digital media relentlessly compete for every second of our focus. This bombardment fractures our attention, diminishing our ability to think deeply, connect meaningfully, and sustain focus over time.
Recent research underscores the consequences of this shift. A study by Sina et al. (2023) found that increased digital media exposure is linked to reduced cognitive functioning in children and adolescents. Excessive screen time impairs executive functions such as decision-making, working memory, and impulse control—skills critical for learning and thriving.
Yet the challenges go deeper. Much of human thought operates beneath conscious awareness, shaped by our environment and experiences (Hayles, 2017). These nonconscious processes are increasingly exploited by algorithms designed to capture and monetise our attention. This exploitation exemplifies the industrial scale ‘race to the bottom of the brainstem’ (Harris, 2017), where corporations profit from manipulating our cognitive vulnerabilities.
The global digital advertising market reflects this trend. In 2022, it was valued at approximately $365 billion and is projected to grow at an annual rate of 15.5% up to 2030 (Grand View Research, 2023). This monetisation of attention profoundly affects the mental health of young people.
The current education system, focused on rote learning, memorisation, and measurable outcomes, neglects to build critical thinking and metacognitive skills. It exacerbates vulnerability to manipulation, particularly for students who lack the resources to resist these pressures. Rising anxiety, reduced focus, and cognitive overload also disproportionately harm disadvantaged learners. Safeguarding in the digital age must go beyond screen time policies; it demands systemic reform that fosters focus, discernment, and critical thinking.
AI’s Boundless Potential
Despite these significant challenges, AI holds transformative potential. Imagine a future where AI acts as a personal tutor for every child, adapting to individual needs and fostering creativity, curiosity, and agency. Adaptive learning platforms like Khan Academy’s AI-Driven tool Khanmigo already hint at what’s possible: a system that personalises education to meet each student's unique needs regardless of socio-economic standing.
AI can also alleviate the burden on teachers, automating administrative tasks and freeing educators to focus on building meaningful relationships with students. Thoughtfully deployed, AI could reduce inequalities, foster human connection, and enhance teaching by enriching creative, critical, and collaborative classroom activities.
Rethinking Education
To guide AI toward a more thoughtful future, we must rethink our approach in three fundamental ways:
1.	How We Learn: Shift away from rote memorisation to personalised, adaptive learning that fosters problem-solving, creativity, and deeper understanding.
2.	What We Learn: Embed critical thinking, collaboration, and AI literacy into the curriculum, equipping students to thrive in a rapidly changing world.
3.	How We Work: Use AI to alleviate administrative burdens, freeing teachers to foster meaningful connections and nurture students' intrinsic growth.
At its best, education equips us to navigate complexity, build connections, and find meaning in our lives. These are not things you can measure in tests or spreadsheets, but they are the foundations of human flourishing.
The Paperclip Maximiser warns us of the dangers of narrow, myopic focus. Have we already turned our education system into its own version of the Paperclip Maximiser? AI will certainly shape the future of learning, but the question is how—and will we be in control?
Will our education system continue failing to prepare our children, deepen inequities, and erode creativity? Or will we guide it to create a system that values curiosity, connection, and human flourishing?
