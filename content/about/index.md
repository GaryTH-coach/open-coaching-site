I’m Gary Handforth — a leadership coach, strategist, and educational consultant with over two decades of experience shaping schools and systems to better serve learners and communities.

My approach is rooted in openness, reflection, and connection. I don’t bring off-the-shelf answers. Instead, I work with you to uncover new perspectives, challenge assumptions, and build clarity in complexity. Whether supporting a school leadership team, designing a coaching culture, or exploring AI’s role in decision-making, I aim to provoke meaningful, grounded change.
