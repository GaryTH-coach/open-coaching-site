+++

I’m Gary Handforth. I coach and develop school leaders through **relational practice**—belonging, trust and honest challenge—so people can do their best work together.

Before coaching, I worked across the system as a **teacher**, **headteacher**, **executive headteacher** and **Director of Education** in a multi-academy trust. That arc keeps my work practical and rooted in real school life.

My approach is shaped by a **BA (Hons) in Psychology** and an **MA in Process Consultancy**: clear thinking, careful listening, and disciplined follow-through.

## What I do now
- **1–to–1 coaching** for heads, deputies and emerging leaders  
- **Leadership development & training** for school and trust teams  
- A **SEND Peer Review (pilot)** applying a relational lens to provision

## How we’ll work
- **Relational first:** build trust and belonging, then do the hard work.  
- **Candid + kind:** clear feedback, never performative.  
- **Context-aware:** tailored to your school’s constraints and strengths.  
- **Doable next steps:** small moves that compound into change.

## A recent example
**Coaching a new head across their first two terms.**  
We clarified purpose, redesigned SLT routines, and established steady staff conversations. Governors reported clearer direction; the team reported “less noise, more progress.” *(Anonymised; details on request.)*
