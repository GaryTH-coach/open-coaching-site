## About Me

I'm Gary Handforth — a leadership coach, strategist, and educational consultant with over two decades of experience shaping schools and systems to better serve learners and communities.

My approach is rooted in openness, reflection, and connection. I don’t bring off-the-shelf answers. Instead, I work with you to uncover new perspectives, challenge assumptions, and build clarity in complexity. Whether supporting a school leadership team, designing a coaching culture, or exploring AI’s role in decision-making, I aim to provoke meaningful, grounded change.

## As a Speaker and Facilitator

I speak at national conferences and roundtables on AI in education, leadership, and ethical innovation. My sessions invite critical thinking and constructive discomfort — always with a view to impact and inclusion.

## Philosophy

I believe leadership is relational, not hierarchical; adaptive, not rigid. I draw from process consultancy, systems thinking, and posthumanist philosophy to create learning environments where people flourish and systems evolve.
